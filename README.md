## My aoc solutions
Since day 7 of 2022, each daily solution is organized as:  
```
dayxx/
    test/
        example.txt         # input used in the exercise description
        result_part1.txt    # given solution part1 should produce when running on the example input
        result_part2.txt    # given solution part2 should produce when running on the example input
    input.txt               # my personal input
    main.py                 # my solution containing both parts
```

## How to run
Simply execute any `main.py` file.  
```
python main.py
```

Doing so will, for both parts, run a test on the example input and then on the actual one if the test passed.
